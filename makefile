# A makefile associates names (aka targets) with usually complex
# terminal commands. 
#
# Each command (or command sequence) begins with a target, which can
# be any name that you choose, left justified. This is followed by, on
# the same line, a list of file names or other targets called
# dependencies. Then, in subsequent lines are the sequence of
# commands, each prefixed by a tab.
